# Classfinder Replacement

This is an attempt at replacing that horrible WWU classfinder site with a better front end.

Currently works by scraping the old pages, so it's going to take a while to set up a proper connector.

If you have ideas or feedback, feel free to create an issue.

Currently hosted at [https://classfinder.page/](https://classfinder.page/)
