# Classfinder Replacement

This is an attempt at replacing that horrible WWU classfinder site with a better front end.

Currently works by scraping the old pages, so it's going to take a while to set up a proper connector.

If you have ideas or feedback, feel free to create an issue.

Currently hosted at [https://classfinder.page/](https://classfinder.page/)

### Project setup

install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and my package manager of choice [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

Then navigate to the directory in terminal and use the command: 

```
yarn install
```
### Development

To run the local dev server, just use the command:

```
yarn serve
```

Please branch for features.
